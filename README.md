Pallanghuzi, or Pallankuli (பல்லாங்குழி in Tamil,"ಅಳಗುಳಿ ಮನೆ" or Alaguli Mane in Kannada, "వామన గుంటలు" or
Picchala Peeta in Telugu, പല്ലാങ്കുഴി in Malayalam), is a traditional ancient Tamil mancala game played in South India especially Tamil Nadu. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallanguzhi

The data was generated by making  a dumb ai and an intelligent ai to play the game.
The dumb ai only knows the basic rules.
The intelligent ai knows how to maximize its gain.
The moves between the two programs  become the dataset. They play multiple games. 

And then a third ai, which has no idea about the game or its rules only learns from the moves generated from the two ai's playing the game.

It uses a Multinomial logistic classifier with Adam optimizer and 1 hidden layer with 28 neurons and ReLU as the activation
function.
